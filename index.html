  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently, I&#8217;ve taken a graduated course in Data Engineering focusing on RDBMS system, parallel data processing, etc. For some reason, I could not understand some concepts introduced in class. So, I&#8217;ve decided to take some time figuring things out by myself. In this post, I&#8217;ll discuss something about hash-based join algorithms used in RDBMS.   <br />
Let <code>h(.)</code> denote a hash function that produces an integer number (a.k.a, hash value) from some specific range corresponding to a given input object. <code>h(.)</code> is expected to satisfy some conditions as below:          </p>

<p>$h(x) \neq h(y) \Rightarrow x \neq y ~\textrm{(1): required}$       <br />
$x = y \Rightarrow h(x) = h(y) ~\textrm{(2): required}$       <br />
$x \neq y$, then <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\left\{\begin{matrix}h(x) \neq h(y) & \textrm{(3): ideal}\\ h(x) = h(y)& \textrm{(4): collision}\end{matrix}\right. %]]></script>  <br />
A <strong>join</strong> of multiple relations in RDBMS is an operation that combines tuples satisfy some predicate on given attribute(s) from all relations. For simplicity, we only consider inner-join of two relations R, S here. Moreover, hash-based join algorithms are often employed for <code>equi-join</code>, with equal predicate, so unless stated otherwise, I&#8217;ll use <code>join</code> to refer to <code>inner equi-join</code> in this post. That&#8217;s too much for introduction, let&#8217;s dive in main points.   </p>

<h3 id="simple-hash-join">1. Simple hash join</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that <code>#|R| &lt; #|S|</code>, and we&#8217;re going to join R and S on attribute <code>a</code>. A simple hash join is simply a two-phase algorithm that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Build phase</strong>: Use a hash function <code>h(.)</code> to build a hash table for R. For example, for a tuple r in R, r will be hashed to a bucket specified by <code>h(r.a)</code>. The main point here is that we use join attribute <code>a</code> to hash all tuples in R. For now, assume that the generated hash table fits into main memory.   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Probe phase</strong>: Scan all tuples of S and apply the same hash function <code>h(.)</code> to test if a given tuple s in S might be joined with some tuples in R. Due to property (1) of <code>h(.)</code>, if $h(r.a) \neq h(s.a)$ then we immediately know that s should not be joined with r without comparing r.a and s.a directly. However, keep in mind that for the case $h(r.a) = h(s.a)$, we still need to check whether r.a = s.a to decide if r and s should be joined together. In probe phase, we might also write out the results to disk.    <br />
The reason why hash-based algorithms might be quite efficient is that we only need to directly compare pairs (r,s) if they are hashed to the same bucket instead of doing this time-consuming task for all pairs (r,s). However, the performance of a hash-based algorithm depends on the choices of the hash function. In ideal cases, we expect that a good hash function will evenly distribute all tuples from R into let&#8217;s say n buckets, and reduce the number of collisions. Then, the expected number of tuples in each bucket is <code>#|R|/n</code>. This is also called <code>load factor</code> of the hash table. We choose hash function and n such that the load factor is a small constant. In average case, hash-based algorithm can be quite fast.     </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What if</strong> the hash table generated in build phase can not be fit in main memory? One simple solution is iteratively run the two-phase algorithm above for <code>|R|/|M|</code> times, where <code>|M|</code> is the size of main memory. Each time, we try to fit as many tuples from R as possible into main memory. This modified algorithm is similar to block nested loop algorithm. Its main drawback is that we have to scan S for many times in probe phases. Also, it&#8217; not easy to parallelize this simple hash join algorithm. So, smart people came up with new algorithm, called <strong>GRACE hash join</strong>! </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bit manipulation problems are always interesting with surprisingly short yet hard-to-understand solutions.  <br />
Today, we consider this problem: <code>Given an integer n, find the position (0-based) of its most significant bit efficiently in terms of time/space complexity.</code>         <br />
In other word, we want to find the biggest integer <code>k</code> such that $2^k \leq n$.     </p>

<h3 id="first-solution-gcc-built-ins">1. First solution: GCC built-ins</h3>
<p>One acceptable solution given that we use <code>gcc</code> is to use its <strong>built-in</strong> function, <code>__builtin_clz</code> (or <code>__builtin_clzll</code> for long long n). Note that, if $n = 0$, then for $\forall k \in \mathbb{Z}$, $2^k &gt; n$, thus in this case the answer is $-\infty$. Simple C++ code is given below.    </p>

<p>The IEEE 754 standard specifies a <strong>binary64</strong> format of a 64-bit double number as: <br />

+ Exponent part: 11 bits  <br />
+ Fraction part: 52 bits  <br />

<h3 id="other-solutions">3. Other solutions</h3>
<p>In Java, <code>Integer.highestOneBit(int n)</code> method does the trick. For more details on bitwise operations in Java, see e.g., <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op3.html">this</a>.  <br />
We can also precalculate values and achieve <code>O(1)</code> time complexity solution at the expense of additional memory. I will update this post whenever I find any new and good solution.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To prevent another sleepless night, I decided to read something on Unicode, which was one of the most confusing things to me at times. In this post, I&#8217;m going to share my bedtime story with you. <br />
You might guess from its name, &#8220;Unicode&#8221;, it&#8217;s kind of universal code things. You&#8217;re nearly true. As you may know, there are many writing systems in the world, each comes with different character sets. For me, that diversity is great, isn&#8217;t it? There would be no problem at all until people started using computers to work with characters. While computers only understand 0-1 language, the ways of translating human characters into 0-1 bits cause troubles. To be more precise, the same 0-1 bit pattern can mean different characters in different writing systems. Let&#8217;s say, your friend send you an email written in Japanese with some mysterious encoding scheme, and unfortunately your computer don&#8217;t know what encoding scheme that email used. As a result, it cannot decode the email correctly and you might end up seeing something like small boxes, question marks, or some funny characters that don&#8217;t make much sense. Well, that was a big headache, and soon we need a universal character sets, that include every reasonable writing system on Earth. So far, I&#8217;m glossed over some concepts, like encoding/decoding scheme.    <br />
+ An encoding scheme, e.g., ASCII, Shift-JIS, is simply a mapping from characters to 0-1 bit patterns. Again, why do we need 0-1 bit patterns? Unless we can make computers understand our natural languages, our messages containing  many characters still need to be converted into 0-1 bit sequences. And then, computers can be able to store and handle them correctly.   <br />
+ A decoding scheme is about the opposite way of encoding. Simply put, it specifies how to translate 0-1 bit sequences back to characters.   <br />
Let&#8217;s digress to a similar story, about encryption/decryption. You encrypt your text by some encryption scheme. To get back your original text, you need a proper decryption scheme to decrypt the cipher text. A cipher text encrypted by a given algorithm need a corresponding decryption algorithm to decipher the encrypted text. That means basically a pair of encryption/decryption algorithms must agree on some internal protocol. Getting back to our main topic, a text encoded in a given scheme A is unlikely to be decoded correctly with different scheme B, unless they share the same character sets and the mapping between charaters and 0-1 bit sequences. </p>

<p>Some people, including me, had been believed that Unicode is just 16-bit code where each character takes 16 bits and therefore there are $2^{16} = 65536$ possible characters in total. But, <strong>THIS IS NOT CORRECT</strong>. In fact, Unicode is <strong>NOT</strong> encoding/decoding scheme, it&#8217;s simply a mapping from characters to somehow conceptual <strong>code-points</strong>. How those code-points are in turn represented in 0-1 bit patterns is a different story and that&#8217;s job of encoding/decoding scheme. So, why do we need to invent Unicode? The idea is that every character in the universal character sets is mapped to a magic number, a.k.a., code-point. For example, the English letter &#8216;A&#8217; is assigned a code-point U+0041. You can find the detailed mapping in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode website</a> or by <em>charmap</em> utility in Windows, etc. With Unicode, we not only obtain an unique mapping between characters and code-points, but also impose <strong>no limit</strong> on the number of letters that Unicode can define. It can be much larger than 65536. So far, so good. Everything is just a bunch of code-points. But, wait&#8230;how to store those code-points in 0-1 bit sequences, that&#8217;s where encodings come in.</p>

<p>The very first idea for Unicode encoding is to store each code-point in two bytes. Also, here comes high-endian and low-endian stories. It&#8217;s again another story, so let&#8217;s leave it for another post. <strong>Fixed two-byte</strong> scheme (a.k.a, UCS-2, UTF-16) seems to be a good solution. However, given that English with 26 simple alphabetical characters is a universal natural language, it seems that we&#8217;re going to waste much storage for many redundant zeros in this fixed two-byte encoding scheme. Thus, a brilliant concept, UTF-8 was invented. Put simply, in UTF-8, we store characters by variable-length bytes. Every code-point from 0-127 is stored in a single byte. Only code-points 128 and above are stored using 2, 3, and up to 6 bytes. This UTF-8 solution seems to be better than fixed two-byte solution, at least in terms of storage, doesn&#8217;t it? There are also other encoding schemes for Unicode, e.g., UTF-7, UTF-32. Note that UTF-7, 8, 16, and 32 all can store any code-point correctly.</p>

<p>Currently, there are still hundreds of traditional encodings which can only store some code-points correctly and change all the other code-points into question marks. Some popular encodings of English text are Windows-1252, Latin-1. As long as people still use some old-school encoding schemes that can&#8217;t store all code-points, we might still see mysterious question marks out there. </p>

<p>OK, this post has gone for so long, and it&#8217;s time to sleep well. You may forget everything I&#8217;ve talked so far. But please keep in mind one important point. <strong>There is no such thing as plain text. In other words, it does not make sense to have text unless you know what encoding scheme was used</strong>. It&#8217;s like you have cipher text without knowing how to decrypt it.</p>

<p>Last question, have you ever been wondering why your smart browsers can decode the 0-1 bit sequences into meaningful web pages. Based on what we&#8217;ve talked so far, browsers must know encoding schemes of the web pages before decoding them. That information about encoding schemes is often stored in a HTTP header, called <strong>Content-Type</strong>, and also in a <strong>meta tag</strong> in HTML files itself. But there are still a lot of web pages coming without any encoding scheme information. They leave the browsers no choice other than guessing encoding schemes. The algorithms that some popular browsers (Firefox, Chrome, IE, etc.,) use to guess encoding schemes are getting quite sophisticated, and do work well, but not perfectly. That&#8217;s why you still see question marks or funny characters some day. To end this bored-stiff post, I&#8217;d like to ask web page writers a favor: <strong>Don&#8217;t forget to put the encoding scheme you use in your HTML file!</strong></p>

<p>Until next time, good bye!    </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this series of posts, I will <strong>informally</strong> discuss some basic things in machine learning theory which I&#8217;ve learnt through my own research experience, lectures, etc. Feel free to leave your comments and share your thoughts in the comment section below. </p>

<p>In this very first post, let&#8217;s get started with one of the most standard problems in <em>supervised learning</em> setting, called <em>regression</em> and some common <em>learning models</em>.</p>

<h3 id="regression-as-functional-approximation">Regression as functional approximation</h3>
<p>We consider the problem of estimating an <em>unknown</em> function <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script>, using a set of samples <script type="math/tex">\{(x_i, y_i)\}</script>, where
<script type="math/tex">y_i = f(x_i) + e_i</script>, and <script type="math/tex">e_i</script> is the <em>i.i.d</em> Gaussian noises. This is a common formulation of regression problem in standard supervised learning setup, where <script type="math/tex">\{(x_i, y_i)\}</script> is often mentioned as <em>training</em> samples, $x_i \in \mathcal{R}^d$ is d-dimensional input vector, and $y_i$ is its corresponding output. For simplicity, we consider only the case where $y_i$ is scalar. <br />
One way to solve the problem above is to search for the <strong>true</strong> function <script type="math/tex">f(x)</script> in a set of functions that is parameterized by parameter vector <script type="math/tex">\theta</script> (a.k.a., a parametric model indexed by parameter <script type="math/tex">\theta</script>). Obviously, if we don&#8217;t have any prior knowledge (about the form of $f(x)$) other than training samples, it&#8217;s almost impossible to obtain exact true function $f(x)$. Instead, we try to find a function in a given model which best approximates $f(x)$. That&#8217;s why we can see regression as functional approximation problem. We often &#8220;learn&#8221; the parameter $\theta$ from training samples by casting our problem into an optimization problem, e.g., minimizing the approximation error. An estimation of $f(x)$, denoted $\hat{f}(x)$ can be obtained by substituting optimized parameter into the model formulation. I will return to this point in later posts. <br />
Below, we discuss some commonly used <strong>parametric models</strong>, with general form
<script type="math/tex">\{f(x; \boldsymbol{\theta})~|~ \boldsymbol{\theta} = (\theta_1,...,\theta_b)^\top\}</script>.</p>

<h3 id="learning-model">Learning model</h3>
<p><strong>1. Linear model</strong>   <br />
Instead of a <em>linear-in-input-feature</em> model, which is often introduced in some stats/ML introductory books/courses, we consider a more general <strong>linear-in-parameter</strong> model:   </p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:f(x; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \sum_{j=1}^b\theta_j\psi_j(x)</script>, where <script type="math/tex">x \in \mathcal{R}^d</script>.  </p>

<p>This <em>linear-in-parameter</em> model includes the former as a special case. We might think this type of model is quite limited due to its linearity, but actually it&#8217;s quite flexible. Particularly, we can customize the basis functions ${\psi_j(x)}$ as freely as we want based on specific problems. For examples, polynomial basis functions or trigonometric basis functions are common choices when d = 1. For high dimensional case, some powerful linear models can be used:  <br />
+ Multiplicative model: It can model very complicated functions in high dimension, but due to very large number of parameters (exponential order w.r.t to the dimensionality d), it can only be applied to <em>not-so-high</em> dimensional case.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">f(x; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \sum_{j_1}...\sum_{j_d}\theta_{j_1,...,j_d}\psi_{j_1}(x^{(1)})...\psi_{j_d}(x^{(d)})</script>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Additive model: much simpler with smaller number of parameters (linear order w.r.t to the dimensionality d) than multiplicative model. Obviously, its expressiveness is more limited than multiplicative model. </li>
</ul>

<p><script type="math/tex">\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:f(x; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \sum_{k=1}^d\sum_j \theta_{k,j}\psi_j(x^{(k)})</script>.</p>

<p><strong>2. Kernel model</strong> </p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:f(x; \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \sum_{j=1}^n \theta_{j} K(x, x_j)</script>.</p>

<p>It is linear-in-parameter but unlike the linear model discussed above, its basis functions depend on training samples <script type="math/tex">\{x_j\}</script>.    <br />
+ The number of parameters is generally independent of the dimensionality d of input. <br />
+ It can be seen as a linear-in-parameter model.  <br />
+ It depends on the training samples, and thus its properties is a bit different from ordinary linear model. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s also known as <strong>non-parametric</strong> model. Discussion on non-parametric model is beyond the scope of this post. In this post, we do not go into the detailed and complicated analysis, then unless otherwise stated, we consider kernel model as a specific case of linear model. <br />
+ It can capture and incoporate characteristics of training samples. This might be useful, but on the other hand, it might be sensitive to the noisy training samples.</p>

<p><strong>3. Non-linear model</strong>    <br />
Simply put, every non-linear w.r.t parameters is called <strong>non-linear</strong> model. For examples, hierachical model (a multi-layer model in perceptron, neuron network, etc.) is well-known, given the popularity of <strong>deep learning</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In this post, I will discuss some simple storage schemas for sparse matrices. <br />
<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This <em>informal</em> note is mainly based on my understanding so far, and for my learning purposes. For more accurate and detailed discussion, please refer to your reliable sources.</p>

<p>A sparse matrix is a matrix, which is almost all <em>zeros</em>. 
In general, a <em>zero</em> can be thought as a meaningless value that we don&#8217;t need to store.
In other words, storing only nonzero items for a sparse matrix is enough. As a result, we can save a lot of memory space, or time to transfer compressed data over networks, etc. But, keep in mind that there might be a <strong>trade-off</strong> between memory efficiency and fast/easy access to nonzero items. We will discuss more about this problem in later posts (I hope so!).</p>

<p>Let M denote a sparse matrix of size <code>R x C</code>. Assume that M contains <code>n</code> nonzero items, where <code>n</code> is significantly smaller than <code>R x C</code>. Below are three simple yet useful storage schemes:<br />
<strong>1. Coordinate Format (COO)</strong>    <br />
A list of triplets <code>(r,c,val)</code>, where <code>val = M[r][c]</code>.   </p>

<p><strong>2. Compressed Sparse Row Format (CSR)</strong> <br />
Basically, all information is stored in 3 arrays:   <br />
  * <code>vals</code>: array of nonzero items in left-to-right, then top-to-bottom order. Hence, vals is a length <code>n</code> array. <br />
  * <code>col_ind</code>: array of column indices (0-based) of nonzero items. Hence, col_ind is a length <code>n</code> array. <br />
  * <code>rs_ind</code>: (index of first nonzero item of each row in vals array). Hence, rs_ind is a length <code>(R+1)</code> array. All nonzero items of M&#8217;s i-th row lies in range <code>[rs_ind[i], rs_ind[i+1]-1]</code> of vals array. That is, if we denote <code>le = rs_ind[i], ri = rs_ind[i+1]-1</code>, then <code>vals[le..ri]</code> are all nonzero items in i-th row of M.  </p>

<p><strong>3. Compressed Sparse Column Format (CSC)</strong>  <br />
This format can be thought as CSR with the roles of row and column exchanged. Then, I will skip the explanation here.</p>
